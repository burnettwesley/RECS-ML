# RECS-LASSO

This repository includes the working paper, data, and Stata (version 16) code for Burnett & Kiesling research using the EIA RECS data. The .do files contain the code and .dta files contain the data to replicate the results. We did separate regression analyses for each survey year of RECS, so the files are labeled according to the survey year. For example, the 2009 survey contains the data file entitled "recs_rates_2009.dta." The main do file to recreate the estimates is entitled "stat_learn_recs.do."
